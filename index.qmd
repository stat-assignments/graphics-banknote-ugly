- In Canvas, submit a link to your github repository containing the updated files.


## Swiss Banknotes

The R package `mclust` contains a data set called banknote, consisting of (physical) measurements on 200 Swiss bank notes, 100 of which are genuine, while the other half is counterfeit. I've saved this data as `banknote.csv` in this repository.


1. Use one of the object inspecting functions and describe the data set - what do the variables appear to mean?



2. Draw a barchart of Status (0 is genuine, 1 is counterfeit). Also, map status to the fill color of the bars. (Yes, this plot is a bit simplistic, but what does it show?)

    Delete this ordered list and write something that includes the following details
    - what type of plot is it? 
    - Which variables are mapped to x, to y, and to the (fill) color? 
    - What is the main message of the plot: what is your main finding, i.e. what do you want viewers to learn from the plot? 
    - Are there any anomalies or outliers?


3. Draw a histogram of one of the variables in the dataset that shows a distinction between genuine and counterfeit banknotes. Use fill color to show this difference. Choose the binwidth such that there are no gaps in the middle range of the histogram.

    Delete this ordered list and write something that includes the following details
    - what type of plot is it? 
    - Which variables are mapped to x, to y, and to the (fill) color? 
    - What is the main message of the plot: what is your main finding, i.e. what do you want viewers to learn from the plot? 
    - Are there any anomalies or outliers?

4. Draw a scatterplot of two (continuous) measurements, color by Y. Try to find a pair of measurements that provides as much separation as possible between the clusters of points for genuine and counterfeit banknotes.

    Delete this ordered list and write something that includes the following details
    - what type of plot is it? 
    - Which variables are mapped to x, to y, and to the (fill) color? 
    - What is the main message of the plot: what is your main finding, i.e. what do you want viewers to learn from the plot? 
    - Are there any anomalies or outliers?

## Take everything you know, and use it for evil

The textbook spent lots of time showing you how to create different types of graphics, but I spent a lot less time showing you all of the different ways you could customize graphics in any plotting library. In this problem, I want you to create the *ugliest* version of the following graphs you can, and then **explain why**, exactly, you made the decisions you did, and which principles of good graphics you've intentionally violated. 

Ugliness is subjective, so the goal here is for you to explore the different ways you can customize the finer details of a plot. Make sure your finished masterpiece has appropriate axis labels and a title (after all, even ugly plots need to be correctly labeled!). You are free to add additional variables and layers, modify the aesthetics used, and leverage other packages. I have provided this code as a starting point, not as a way to limit your creativity. [If you need inspiration, look here.](https://www.allisonhorst.com/post/do-your-worst/)

You have two datasets to plot here:

- `penguins.csv`, which is just the penguins data from the `palmerpenguins` R package, exported.
- `2021 NTSE Endowment Market Values US and Canadian Institutions--REVISED March 1 2022.xlsx`, which is a dataset about 2021 Endowment market values for US and canadian educational institutions. Obtained from https://www.nacubo.org/Research/2021/Public-NTSE-Tables.

You can use R for one dataset, and python for the other. Create the ugliest graph you can manage with each dataset. You can pick which variables to plot, what type of chart to make, and what aesthetic mappings to use.
